# V4N<sup>2</sup>

V4N<sup>2</sup> is a case for [V4N4G0N](https://trashman.wiki/keyboards/v4n4g0n)-compatible PCBs. Originally designed for [Monorail](https://trashman.wiki/en/community/pcbs/monorail) which has 2 USB ports (only 1 is usable at a time, **do not plug both ports at the same time**), hence the <sup>2</sup> name.

V4N<sup>2</sup> utilizes [Hullagon aka. R3 V4N4G0N plate](https://trashman.wiki/en/files#v4n4g0n) and mounting. The bottom part can be use as a low profile case without the top part.

The bottom part has 2 variants: Angled (5&deg;) and Flat.
Both variants are compatible with all V4N4G0N PCBs. There are 2 versions for each variants: dual and single USB ports. For regular V4N4G0N PCB, single port version should be used.

The top part has 3 variants:
* Universal. No blocker and compatible with all V4N4G0N PCBs.
* HHKB. HHKB-style blocker with symmetrical 1.25u blockers on the left and right corner. Only compatible with Monorail Steam PCB.
* WKL. WKL-style blocker with symmetrical 1u blockers on the left and right side. Only compatible with Monorail Steam PCB.
