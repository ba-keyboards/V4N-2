V4N<sup>2</sup> is a case for [V4N4G0N](https://trashman.wiki/keyboards/v4n4g0n)-compatible PCBs. Originally designed for [Monorail](https://trashman.wiki/en/community/pcbs/monorail) which has 2 USB ports (only 1 is usable at a time, **do not plug both ports at the same time**), hence the <sup>2</sup> name.

V4N<sup>2</sup> utilizes [Hullagon aka. R3 V4N4G0N plate](https://trashman.wiki/en/files#v4n4g0n) and mounting. The bottom part can be used without the top part as a low profile case.

## Variants

The bottom part has 2 variants: Angled (5&deg;) and Flat.
Both variants are compatible with all V4N4G0N PCBs. There are 2 versions for each variants: single and dual USB ports.
